Dear Nintendo,

If you are reading this, please don’t sue me! ^^

I am a game developer dedicated to sharpening my skills by recreating the iconic games that shaped history. Super Mario Bros. was one of the first games I ever played as a child. This is a non-profit, fan-made project created solely for educational purposes and out of pure respect for the original masterpiece.
